# About BMP
<p> The Texas Best Management Practices site has been down for some time. But, there is great content that was put together that is still very useful. The current goal is to resurrect the former website to expose the information. Subsequent improvements to the site may be made but those are currently out of scope for the initial re-launch of the site.
This staging repository is to allow the team to edit/revise/remove content before re-launch.

* Status: [Former website being resurrected]
* Team: [Tyson Broad; Megan Bean; Tim McGrath] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2020-04-24 last updated] <!-- optional -->
